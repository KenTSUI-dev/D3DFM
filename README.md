# D3DFM
The Delft3D Flexible Mesh Processing Tool offers two key functions to enhance the use and visualization of modelling results from Delft3D FM:
* Conversion of modelling results from Delft3D FM, which are in netCDF format using the [UGRID convention](http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions/), into a netCDF format that adheres to the [Climate & Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/). The CF conversion enables direct support and visualisation for the resulting data in various CF compliant software applications, particularly [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/multidimensional/essential-netcdf-vocabulary.htm).

* Uploading the converted netCDF file into ArcGIS Online / ArcGIS Server as an Imagery Layer, allowing users to easily visualise the modelling results via a web browser.

## Requirements

Create a conda virtual environment of Python 3.9:

    conda create -n D3DFM python=3.9

Set up the environment with environment.yml:

    conda env update --file environment.yml --prune

## Command Line Interface (`cli.py`)
Command Line Interface (cli.py)

This script provides a command-line interface to rasterize and upload D3DFM NetCDF data to ArcGIS Online. The script includes three options:

- `rasterize`: Rasterizes (i.e. converts from UGRID to CF) an input NetCDF file using information from an input file, and saves the output rasterized NetCDF file to a specified location.
- `uploadagol`: Uploads an input rasterized NetCDF to ArcGIS Online using information from an input file, and optionally generates a vector field from the uploaded data using the `--vectorize` option.
- `vectorize`: Generates a vector field from an uploaded NetCDF data item in ArcGIS Online.

Usage

Example 1: Rasterize a NetCDF file

```
python cli.py rasterize INPUTFILE1.TXT
```

In this example, the script will rasterize the D3DFM NetCDF file based on the input parameters in the `INPUTFILE1.TXT` file.

Example 2: Upload a rasterized NetCDF file

```
python cli.py uploadagol INPUTFILE2.TXT
```

In this example, the script will upload the rasterized NetCDF file to ArcGIS Online based on the input parameters in the `INPUTFILE2.TXT` file.

Example 3: Upload a rasterized NetCDF file and generate a vector field service from the uploaded data

```
python cli.py uploadagol INPUTFILE2.TXT --vectorize
```

In this example, the script will upload the rasterized NetCDF file to ArcGIS Online based on the input parameters in the `INPUTFILE2.TXT` file. The uploaded data will be used to generate a vector field service.

Example 4: Generate a vector field from an uploaded NetCDF data item in ArcGIS Online

```
python cli.py vectorize INPUTFILE3.TXT
```

In this example, the script will generate a vector field from an uploaded NetCDF data item in ArcGIS Online using the input parameters in the `INPUTFILE3.TXT` file.

Input File Format

The input files for `rasterize`, `uploadagol`, and `vectorize` should contain the following information:

- `rasterize`:
    1. Path to input NetCDF file
    2. Path to output NetCDF file
    3. Comma-separated list of variable names to rasterize
    4. Range of times to rasterize (in the format `start,end,step` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, step`)
    5. Comma-separated list of layer names to rasterize
    6. Comma-separated list of bounding box coordinates (in the format `xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax`)
    7. Number of cells in x direction
    8. Number of cells in y direction
    9. Data type for the output NetCDF file (int8 or int16)

Each line should be separated by a newline character. A sample input file is as follows:

```
D:\temp\D3DFM_2022Sep\HK-FM_merged_mapSep.nc
D:\temp\D3DFM_2022Sep\HK-FM_merged_mapSep_raster4.nc
mesh2d_sa1
2023-06-01T00:00:00, 2023-06-30T00:00:01, 1
0, 10, 19
113.213111, 21.917770, 114.627601, 23.145613
800
800
int8
```

- `uploadagol`:
    1. ArcGIS Online username
    2. ArcGIS Online password
    3. Path to input rasterized NetCDF file
    4. Name of output service
    5. Name of x-component of vector field variable (if --vectorize is specified)
    6. Name of y-component of vector field variable (if --vectorize is specified)
    7. Name of output vector field service (if --vectorize is specified)


Each line should be separated by a newline character. A sample input file is as follows:

```
username
password
D:\temp\20230118_Tree\HK-FM_merged_map_ucxucy_dry1.nc
Test_Dry_ucxucy
mesh2d_ucx
mesh2d_ucy
Test_Dry_VecFie
```

- `vectorize`:
    1. ArcGIS Online username
    2. ArcGIS Online password
    3. Item ID
    4. Name of x-component of vector field variable
    5. Name of y-component of vector field variable
    6. Name of output vector field service

Each line should be separated by a newline character. A sample input file is as follows:

```
username
password
779aaa999bbbcccddd666eeefff333ff
mesh2d_ucx
mesh2d_ucy
Test_Dry_VecFie
```

Note that the `vectorize` option requires an uploaded rasterized NetCDF data item in ArcGIS Online.
